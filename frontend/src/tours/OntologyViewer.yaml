      This is the "Ontology Viewer" - a core component of the Medical Concept Builder.  
      It allows you to browse all the medical ontologies we offer, view codelists in the context of the ontology trees
      and compare multiple codelists.

      Let's guide you through this feature.
  - title: 'Code View'
    name: code-view
    target: __ontology-main__
    description: >
      In this section, the codes of the selected ontology are displayed. By default this is a hierarchical view.
      Click on the carets (triangles) or simply the code description to view lower level codes.
  - title: 'Search'
    name: search
    target: __ontology-search__
    description: >
      The search can be performed on the code description or the code itself. To search, type something in the search
      box and click on the search button or press enter.
      For searching on the code itself, you can choose between two different formats. By default you are using the
      simple mode. You always have to search for the complete code. As placeholder you can use "%" for any amount
      of characters and "_" for a single character. For example, if you want to search for all codes starting with "A",
      you can search for "A%". If you want to search for all three character codes starting with "A", you can search
      for "A__".  
      To switch to regex mode, click the _.*_ icon. In this mode you can use
      [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to search for codes.

      The code view will be filtered according to the search results.
  - title: 'Ontology Selection'
    name: ontology-selector
    target: __ontology-selector__
    description: >
      This is the Ontology Selector. Click on this dropdown and select the Ontology you wish to view.
      The codes of that Ontology will be displayed below.
  - title: 'Ontology Menu'
    name: ontology-menu
    target: __ontology-menu__
    description: >
      When you click these three dots, the Ontology Viewer Menu will open. Here you can configure the Ontology Viewer.
      You can change the view to a flat view, which will display all codes in a flat list. You can apply some quick
      filters to the code view. Or you can execute soe quick actions like "Collapse all tiers".
  - title: 'Active Codelists'
    name: active-codelists
    target: __ontology-active-codelists__
    description: >
      This is the Active Codelists section. Here you can see all the codelists that are currently active and displayed
      in the Ontology Viewer.
