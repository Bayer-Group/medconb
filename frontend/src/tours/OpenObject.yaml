      You can open an object in edit mode, e.g. by clicking on it in the sidebar on the name. A tap opens. At first, it is a “transient” tab, and its title is written in italic; which indicates that it will close as soon as you open another object. You can pin an object by double-clicking on the tab or using the pin icon on the object page. This is especially useful when you want to add objects or compare them.
