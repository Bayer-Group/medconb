# Medical Concept Builder

A critical task during the preparation of any study using real world data (RWD) is to translate medical knowledge into a machine readable format. Real World Data (RWD) is data collected in hospitals and clinics describing every transaction that occurs during routine medical care. Transactions are encoded in these databases in various coding ontologies (e.g. ICD-9, ICD-10-CM, CPRD, NDC). A set of codes in these ontologies referring to an underlying medical condition is referred to as medical concept. These medical concepts are used to extract any medically relevant information, for example, to describe study inclusion and exclusion criteria (who qualifies for the study), and outcomes (what the study looks at). The construction of medical concepts is a complex task that requires the input of medical experts, and has a strong impact on the quality and results of RWD studies. With the Medical Concept Builder we aim to provide a tool for medical experts to easily translate their expert domain knowledge into machine readable/usable formats that can immediately be used in the development of high quality and reliable studies.

We aim to aid clinicians and pharmaco-epidemiologists speak the same language through streamlined knowledge curation interfaces. Through linked data and ontologies we will be able to link RWD sources to clinical studies, and in the future, to early research and development drug targets.

We will allow pharmaco-epidemiological studies to speak the same language as clinicians. We aim to streamline the processes of comparative analyses and observational research in Real World Data by building tools that allow domain knowledge experts to easily translate their knowledge into computer readable/usable formats.
